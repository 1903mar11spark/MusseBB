                <h3 class="head2">Battle for Castle Black</h3>
        <p>Jon's herocisim  began prior to the Battle when he entrenched himself behind enemy lines, feigning as a deserter who joined the Wildlings. Jon was secretly a double spy and brought back the information he garnered to his Night's Watch brothers.</p>
        <p>Jon meets with Mance Rayder in his tent, where they discuss the battle and the Night's Watch's slim chances of victory.
            Jon tells Mance he must take his army and return home, while Mance reveals he sent 400 wildlings to scale the Wall five miles west of Castle Black,
         and demands the Watch open the gate or he will kill every black brother there. Shortly thereafter,  horns and trumpets sound in the distance. </p>
         <p>Hundreds of cavalrymen charge into the wildling camp carrying the flaming stag banners of House Baratheon of Dragonstone, led by Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth. Because they were only expecting attacks from the Wall, the wildlings left their eastern flank totally undefended: they are taken by complete surprise while still in their own camp, many of them still resting from the fighting the night before.They panic and are quickly torn apart by Stannis's riders, who attack the camp from both sides in two large pincer formations, and catch the wildlings in a perfect double envelopment. Seeing his men being massacred in a one-sided fight, Mance gives the order to stand down, officially ending the wildlings' siege of Castle Black. Jon's leadership earned him the respect of his sworn brothers, who in return elected him Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.</p>
        <h3 class="head2">Take back Winterfell</h3>
        <p>The Battle of the Bastards is a battle late in the War of the Five Kings in which Jon Snow and Sansa Stark retake Winterfell from Lord Ramsay Bolton, the Warden of the North, and restore House Stark as the ruling house of the North. Fought just outside of Winterfell, the Stark-led makeshift force of Free Folk and other minor Northern houses is on the verge of defeat when the knights of the Vale arrive in time to smash through the Bolton infantry on the rear. The battle ultimately culminates in Ramsay's death, the extinction of House Bolton and the restoration of House Stark as the rulers of the North, with Jon proclaimed as King by his vassals in the days after the battle. Following the deaths of Lord Harald Karstark and Lord Smalljon Umber during the battle, the Lordships of the Houses Karstark and Umber pass to Alys Karstark and Ned Umber, respectively, who are allowed to retain their lands and titles by the newly proclaimed King in the North.</p>
