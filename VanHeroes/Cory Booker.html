        <h2>Heroic Achievements</h2>

        <h3 class="head2">Saved a Dog</h3>
        <p>Reporter Toni Yates first noticed a dog suffering in the below-freezing temperatures while filming footage for a segment, but when she saw the dog was still outside hours later, she tweeted at Booker to take action — and that’s exactly what he did. The mayor arrived, scooped the dog up and carried it into a police car before delivering a stern warning by phone to the dog’s owners, who claimed they didn’t know “Cha Cha” had escaped outside.</p>
        <p>“This dog is shaking really bad, and you just can’t leave your dogs out here on a day like this and go away and expect them to be O.K.,” Booker told WABC. “Hypothermia on any animal, including a human animal, will set in pretty quickly. So this is very sad, you can just feel the dog shaking pretty badly.”</p>
        <h3 class="head2">Helped shovel his constituents driveways after a blizzard</h3>
        <p>In winter of 2010, Booker turned his @CoryBooker Twitter account into a blizzard help line. When one man tweeted that his sister couldn’t make it through the snow to buy diapers, Booker showed up at her house with diapers. When locals were stuck in their cars (or, in one case, on a bus), Booker and his team helped dig them out the old-fashioned way: with shovels.</p>
        <h3 class="head2">Saved a Woman from a Burning Building</h3>
        <p>Booker saw flames and smoke pouring from the second floor of the small apartment building next to his home late Thursday night after he returned from an interview with a local news program. But seeing no residents outside, he rushed into the two-story building, looking for residents with his three-man security detail in tow, New Jersey’s Newark Star-Ledger reports.</p>
        <p>“I just grabbed her and whipped her out of the bed,” said Booker, who rescued a resident amid a raging fire. “My first instinct when I jumped through the kitchen, which was all in flames, I actually wasn’t thinking. But then when I got there and couldn’t find her in all the smoke … that’s when I had very clear thoughts that ‘I’m not going to get out of this place alive,’” Booker said in an interview Friday with CBS “This Morning.”</p>
        <p>“You know, it’s your ‘Come to Jesus’ moment,” Booker said. “Yesterday, all my problems were really big to me. Today things feel a lot more clear, and I have a lot more respect for firefighters.” Booker also dismissed his branding as a “superhero” after rescuing the woman.</p>
